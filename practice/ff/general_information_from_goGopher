The following is posted by the KLIFF author (goGopher) at https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/questions/8932/what-are-some-open-source-codes-that-can-generate-potentials

Check existing potentials repository
Before fitting a new model, first try searching the repositories

OpenKIM (https://openkim.org)
NIST (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/)
to see whether you can find one that satisfies your needs. Via the KIM API (https://openkim.org/kim-api), models archived on OpenKIM can be used in various molecular simulation codes, such as LAMMPS, ASE, DL_POLY, GULP, and ASAP. OpenKIM also provides analysis of each model (e.g. citation analysis and tests on canonical properties like cohesive energy and elastic constant), which may help you to decide whether a model satisfies your need. For an example, see https://openkim.org/id/EAM_Dynamo_Ackland_1992_Ti__MO_748534961139_005.

Build new potentials
If none satisfies the need, there are basically three steps to create a new model.

Assemble a dataset
Traditionally, potentials are fit to reproduce a set of experimental properties, but nowadays most potentials are fit to more easily obtainable properties from quantum mechanical calculations.

Here are some DFT codes that can be used to generate a dataset of energy, forces, and stress for training the model.

Quantum Espresso (open source) https://www.quantum-espresso.org
VASP (commercial) https://www.vasp.at
ABINIT (open source) https://www.abinit.org
SIESTA (open source) https://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/
CP2K (open source) https://www.cp2k.org
If you do not want to generate a dataset by yourself, some computational materials databases may have DFT data that can be used for fitting a potential, such as

The Materials Project https://materialsproject.org
AFLOW http://www.aflowlib.org
OQMD https://oqmd.org
NOMAD https://nomad-lab.eu
JARVIS https://jarvis.nist.gov
Train the model
Given a dataset, many open-source codes can be used to fit a potential. Below are some widely used ones, and I categorize them into codes that build physics-based models (e.g. Tersoff) or build machine learning models (e.g. neural network).

Physics based

Machine learning

MTP (Moment tensor potential) https://mlip.skoltech.ru
SNAP (Spectral neighbor analysis potential) https://github.com/FitSNAP/FitSNAP

AMP (Behler--Parrinello type neural network) https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp
aenet (Behler--Parrinello type neural network) http://ann.atomistic.net
DeePMD https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit
SchNet (graph neural network) https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack
NequIP (equivariant graph neural network) https://github.com/mir-group/nequip
Deploy the model
Most of the fitting codes listed above do have an interface to either LAMMPS or ASE, or both. So deploying the fitted model for simulation is typically not a problem. PANNA, potfit, and KLIFF have interfaces to the KIM API, and potentials created with them can be used in multiple simulation codes.
